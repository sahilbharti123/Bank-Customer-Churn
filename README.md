# Customer Churn Prediction App

Imagine predicting whether a customer will churn before they even decide to leave. This project, a customer churn prediction app, leverages machine learning and web development to turn that possibility into reality.

## Technical Stack:

### Machine Learning: 
I trained and analyzed various models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, optional: Neural Network) to identify patterns in customer data and predict churn probability.

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: 
I meticulously prepared the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and crafting relevant features for optimal model performance.

### Web Development: 
Utilizing Streamlit, I built a user-friendly web app for seamless interaction with the prediction model. It allows users to easily input customer details and receive instant churn predictions.

## My Contributions:

### Model Selection and Training: 
I evaluated different models, choosing the combination that yielded the highest accuracy and interpretability.

### Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering: 
I transformed raw data into a format suitable for model training, extracting valuable insights through feature engineering.

### Web App Development: 
I designed and implemented the interactive web interface, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Project Impact:

### Enhanced Customer Retention: 
Businesses can proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

### Data-Driven Decision Making: 
Churn predictions inform marketing efforts, resource allocation, and product development, leading to more effective customer management.

### Scalability and Future Potential: 
The app can be readily extended to incorporate additional features like churn risk segmentation and personalized retention campaigns.
